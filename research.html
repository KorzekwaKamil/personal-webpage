            <p class="mathjax">At the moment I am mostly focusing on various approaches to capture the notions of reversibility and irreversibility in the quantum regime, and thus my work revolves around information-theoretic ways to describe the second law of thermodynamics. This includes investigating the problem of state interconversion under constrained dynamics (especially in the non-asymptotic regime), studying structural differences between classical stochastic dynamics and open quantum dynamics, and understanding the role of memory in dissipation processes. Besides these topics, I am also working on designing optimal classical algorithms for the simulation of quantum circuits.</p>

                <p>When speaking of thermodynamics one inevitably thinks of concepts such as heat flows, thermal machines and pressure, which seem to be far removed from the ideas of quantum information theory. However, on a more abstract level, thermodynamics can be seen as a field studying the accessibility/inaccessibility of one physical state from another. The first and second laws of thermodynamics are fundamental constraints on state transformations, forcing thermodynamic processes to conserve the overall energy and forbidding free conversion of heat into work. Hence, the resource-theoretic machinery originally developed to study entanglement is also perfectly suited to shed light on thermodynamics. </p> 
                <p>In my research I mostly focus on the role that superposition principle plays in thermodynamic considerations. More precisely, I am interested in thermodynamic limitations on processing quantum coherence, the way it affects the thermodynamic arrow of time and the possibility of exploiting coherence to enhance the performance of heat engines. These foundational questions may be of interest for future advancements in nanotechnology, as interference effects are particularly relevant at scales we are increasingly able to control. Recently I am also interested in the problem of thermodynamic (and general resource-theoretic) transformations of finite-size systems, and in particular the effect this non-asymptotic regime has on reversible transformations.</p>

                                <p><i>Abstract: </i>We study work extraction processes mediated by finite-time interactions with an ambient bath — <i>partial thermalizations</i> — as continuous time Markov processes for two-level systems. Such a stochastic process results in fluctuations in the amount of work that can be extracted and is characterized by the rate at which the system parameters are driven in addition to the rate of thermalization with the bath. We analyze the distribution of work for the case where the energy gap of a two-level system is driven at a constant rate. We derive analytic expressions for average work and lower bound for the variance of work showing that such processes cannot be fluctuation-free in general. We also observe that an upper bound for the Monte Carlo estimate of the variance of work can be obtained using Jarzynski's fluctuation-dissipation relation for systems initially in equilibrium. Finally, we analyse work extraction cycles by modifying the Carnot cycle, incorporating processes involving partial thermalizations and obtain efficiency at maximum power for such finite-time work extraction cycles under different sets of constraints.

                                <p><i>Abstract: </i>We identify and explore the intriguing property of resource resonance arising within resource theories of entanglement, coherence and thermodynamics. While the theories considered are reversible asymptotically, the same is generally not true in realistic scenarios where the available resources are bounded. The finite-size effects responsible for this irreversibility could potentially prohibit small quantum information processors or thermal machines from achieving their full potential. Nevertheless, we show here that by carefully engineering the resource interconversion process any such losses can be greatly suppressed. Our results are predicted by higher order expansions of the trade-off between the rate of resource interconversion and the achieved fidelity, and are verified by exact numerical optimizations of appropriate approximate majorization conditions.

                                <p><i>Popular summary:</i> Due to the rapid progress in experimental control of intermediate-scale quantum systems, we may soon witness the emergence of new technologies that will utilize quantum resources to overcome current technological constraints. From a theoretical perspective, it is then crucial to understand the potential and limitations of manipulating and interconverting these resources in realistic scenarios, when only finite amounts of resources are available. In our work we address this pressing issue by developing a rigorous mathematical framework that allows one to investigate resource interconversion of finite-size systems within resource theories of entanglement, coherence and thermodynamics. This allows us to quantitatively analyse the irreversibility (and thus the unavoidable loss) of the conversion process arising from finite-size effects. Although this could potentially prohibit small quantum information processors or thermal machines from achieving their full potential, we show that by carefully engineering the resource interconversion process any such losses can be greatly suppressed. More precisely, we identify and explore the intriguing property of resource resonance that ensures that certain pairs of resources can be interconverted at greatly reduced loss. By analysing its applications within quantum thermodynamics and entanglement theory, we further explain how the resonance phenomenon can be employed to enhance the performance of intermediate-scale quantum devices and thermal machines developed in the near term.</p>

                                <p><i>Abstract: </i>We consider the problem of interconverting a finite amount of resources within all theories whose single-shot transformation rules are based on a majorisation relation, e.g. the resource theories of entanglement and coherence (for pure state transformations), as well as thermodynamics (for energy-incoherent transformations). When only finite resources are available we expect to see a non-trivial trade-off between the rate \(r_n\) at which \(n\) copies of a resource state \(\rho\) can be transformed into \(nr_n\) copies of another resource state \(\sigma\), and the error level \(\epsilon_n\) of the interconversion process, as a function of \(n\). In this work we derive the optimal trade-off in the so-called moderate deviation regime, where the rate of interconversion \(r_n\) approaches its optimum in the asymptotic limit of unbounded resources (\(n\to\infty\)), while the error \(\epsilon_n\) vanishes in the same limit. We find that the moderate deviation analysis exhibits a resonance behaviour which implies that certain pairs of resource states can be interconverted at the asymptotically optimal rate with negligible error, even in the finite \(n\) regime.

                                <p><i>Abstract: </i>Thermodynamics is traditionally constrained to the study of macroscopic systems whose energy fluctuations are negligible compared to their average energy. Here, we push beyond this thermodynamic limit by developing a mathematical framework to rigorously address the problem of thermodynamic transformations of finite-size systems. More formally, we analyse state interconversion under thermal operations and between arbitrary energy-incoherent states. We find precise relations between the optimal rate at which interconversion can take place and the desired infidelity of the final state when the system size is sufficiently large. These so-called second-order asymptotics provide a bridge between the extreme cases of single-shot thermodynamics and the asymptotic limit of infinitely large systems. We illustrate the utility of our results with several examples. We first show how thermodynamic cycles are affected by irreversibility due to finite-size effects. We then provide a precise expression for the gap between the distillable work and work of formation that opens away from the thermodynamic limit. Finally, we explain how the performance of a heat engine gets affected when one of the heat baths it operates between is finite. We find that while perfect work cannot generally be extracted at Carnot efficiency, there are conditions under which these finite-size effects vanish. In deriving our results we also clarify relations between different notions of approximate majorisation.

                                <p><i>Popular summary:</i> Thermodynamics is one of the most versatile physical theories, finding applications in almost all fields of science, from cosmology and astrophysics to chemistry and the theory of computation. Its strength comes from the fact that it provides a universal framework that uses statistical tools to study physical phenomena in the so-called thermodynamic limit, i.e., when the number of involved systems is very large. However, our increasing ability to manipulate and control systems at smaller and smaller scales allows us to build novel nanodevices operating well beyond the thermodynamic limit. Therefore, in order to understand the thermodynamic properties of such devices, we need to formulate a theory that is not constrained to the study of macroscopic systems. In this paper we achieve this by developing an information-theoretic framework describing thermodynamic transformations of finite-size systems. One immediate application of our theoretical results is to the study of irreversible processes in the nanoscale regime. In particular, we show how the amount of ordered energy needed to drive a small system out of equilibrium is larger than the amount one could obtain in a reverse process. This affects reversibility of thermodynamic cycles and, in turn, deteriorates performance of nanoengines. Despite these negative finite-size effects, we find that in specially engineered conditions nanoscale engines can still achieve the ultimate limit of efficiency. Our results expand the realm of applicability of thermodynamics beyond the constraint of macroscopic systems, and thus provide new tools to study the universe at the smallest scale.</p>

                                <p><i>Abstract: </i>In this work we analyse the structure of the thermodynamic arrow of time, defined by transformations that leave the thermal equilibrium state unchanged, in classical (incoherent) and quantum (coherent) regimes. We note that in the infinite-temperature limit the thermodynamic ordering of states in both regimes exhibits a lattice structure. This means that when energy does not matter and the only thermodynamic resource is given by information, the thermodynamic arrow of time has a very specific structure. Namely, for any two states at present there exists a unique state in the past consistent with them and with all possible joint pasts. Similarly, there also exists a unique state in the future consistent with those states and with all possible joint futures. We also show that the lattice structure in the classical regime is broken at finite temperatures, i.e., when energy is a relevant thermodynamic resource. Surprisingly, however, we prove that in the simplest quantum scenario of a two-dimensional system, this structure is preserved at finite temperatures. We provide the physical interpretation of these results by introducing and analysing the history erasure process, and point out that quantum coherence may be a necessary resource for the existence of an optimal erasure process.

                                <p><i>Abstract: </i>The interplay between quantum-mechanical properties, such as coherence, and classical notions, such as energy, is a subtle topic at the forefront of quantum thermodynamics. The traditional Carnot argument limits the conversion of heat to work; here we critically assess the problem of converting coherence to work. Through a careful account of all resources involved in the thermodynamic transformations within a fully quantum-mechanical treatment, we show that there exist thermal machines extracting work from coherence arbitrarily well. Such machines only need to act on individual copies of a state and can be reused. On the other hand, we show that for any thermal machine with finite resources not all the coherence of a state can be extracted as work. However, even bounded thermal machines can be reused infinitely many times in the process of work extraction from coherence.

                                <p><i>Abstract: </i>The first law of thermodynamics imposes not just a constraint on the energy-content of systems in extreme quantum regimes, but also symmetry-constraints related to the thermodynamic processing of quantum coherence. We show that this thermodynamic symmetry decomposes any quantum state into mode operators that quantify the coherence present in the state. We then establish general upper and lower bounds for the evolution of quantum coherence under arbitrary thermal operations, valid for any temperature. We identify primitive coherence manipulations and show that the transfer of coherence between energy levels manifests irreversibility not captured by free energy. Moreover, the recently developed thermo-majorization relations on block-diagonal quantum states are observed to be special cases of this symmetry analysis.

                                <p><i>Popular summary:</i> The remarkable discovery that energy at microscopic scales often comes in discrete chunks originated in Planck's attempt to understand the way that hot bodies glow. Thus began the long and intimate relationship between the field of thermodynamics, which explores our ability to manipulate heat and other energy transfers between macroscopic systems, and quantum mechanics, which explains the dynamics of individual microscopic systems. Even as both our technology and our theoretical investigations have extended to ever-smaller devices, our understanding of quantum effects on thermodynamics has remained almost exclusively limited to the quantized nature of energy. There is much more, however, to quantum theory than energy quantization; here our focus has been the property of quantum coherence  the ability of quantum systems to emulate Schroedinger's cat and somehow be neither "dead and alive" nor "dead or alive" but something completely different altogether. We have discovered how to simplify our understanding of the thermal processing of coherence by using the fact that thermodynamical processes obey time-translation symmetry. This enables quantification of the way coherence can play an active role, facilitating the otherwise-impossible unlocking of energy from certain systems. We have conversely found fundamental limitations on how coherence can be irreversibly manipulated, limitations related to those on energy transfer as dictated by the Second Law of thermodynamics. It has long been appreciated that understanding of thermodynamics must be accompanied by an understanding of information theory. Our work provides evidence that to apply the laws of thermodynamics to the smallest systems around us necessitates an understanding of quantum information theory.</p>

                <p>Although quantum mechanics owes its name to the quantisation of energy, postulated at the beginning of the 20th century by the old quantum theory, its counter-intuitive “weirdness” comes from the superposition principle that was discovered a quarter of a century later. Concepts such as Schrödinger’s cat, quantum teleportation and quantum computing all stem from this fundamental rule of the quantum realm: given two valid states of a system, e.g., spin-up and spin-down, their coherent superposition is also a valid state.</p>
                <p>Beyond the role that quantum coherence plays in thermodynamics, I am also interested in characterizing it as a resource in general quantum information scenarios. This involves studies on optimal processing of coherence (i.e., finding the ultimate limits of avoiding decoherence processes that deteriorate quantum information), understanding how it affects the nature of reversible processes and investigating the role quantum coherence plays in distinguishing physical states and processes.</p>

                                <p><i>Popular summary:</i> For the last three decades, scientists have been harnessing the quantum features of nature to challenge the best known classical methods of computing, metrology and cryptography. In all these cases, quantum superposition allows one to perform certain tasks faster, more precisely, or more securely. Here, we report and investigate a novel quantum advantage that reduces the amount of memory and time-steps needed to implement certain dynamical processes, such as thermodynamic cooling or information processing. In our work we introduce a unifying framework to theoretically analyse memory and time costs from a mathematical, computational and thermodynamical point of view, and apply it to study three distinct scenarios where quantum advantages arise. First, we show that there exist stochastic processes that cannot be simulated classically without memory, but can be implemented quantumly in a memoryless fashion. Second, we prove that for processes that require memory even in the quantum regime, there is an unbounded improvement in the number of times the memory has to be accessed or in its size. Third, we demonstrate that memoryless quantum processes allow one for a much better control of the system’s state than their classical counterparts. Our work provides new tools to quantify the extent to which quantum superposition can replace the role that classically is played by memory. This shows that quantum mechanics provides powerful models to simulate stochastic processes and paves the way to the investigation of practical advantages in near-term quantum devices.</p>

                                <p><i>Abstract: </i>We investigate the problem of simulating classical stochastic processes through quantum dynamics, and present three scenarios where memory/time quantum advantages arise. First, by introducing and analysing a quantum version of the embeddability problem for stochastic matrices, we show that quantum memoryless dynamics can simulate classical processes that necessarily require memory. Second, by extending the notion of space-time cost of a stochastic process \(P\) to the quantum domain, we prove an exponential advantage of the quantum cost of simulating \(P\) over the classical cost. Third, we demonstrate that the set of classical states accessible via Markovian master equations with quantum controls is larger than the set of those accessible with classical controls, leading, e.g., to an advantage in cooling protocols. To achieve this last point, we develop the notion of continuous thermo-majorisation, which strengthens the so-called "second laws" by including the typical constraint that the dynamics is (effectively) Markovian.

                                <p><i>Abstract: </i>We introduce and analyse the problem of encoding classical information into different resources of a quantum state. More precisely, we consider a general class of communication scenarios characterised by encoding operations that commute with a unique resource destroying map and leave free states invariant. Our motivating example is given by encoding information into coherences of a quantum system with respect to a fixed basis (with unitaries diagonal in that basis as encodings and the decoherence channel as a resource destroying map), but the generality of the framework allows us to explore applications ranging from super-dense coding to thermodynamics. For any state, we find that the number of messages that can be encoded into it using such operations in a one-shot scenario is upper-bounded in terms of the information spectrum relative entropy between the given state and its version with erased resources. Furthermore, if the resource destroying map is a twirling channel over some unitary group, we find matching one-shot lower-bounds as well. In the asymptotic setting where we encode into many copies of the resource state, our bounds yield an operational interpretation of resource monotones such as the relative entropy of coherence and its corresponding relative entropy variance.

                                <p><i>Abstract: </i>We investigate an original family of quantum distinguishability problems, where the goal is to perfectly distinguish between \(M\) quantum states that become identical under a completely decohering map. Similarly, we study distinguishability of \(M\) quantum channels that cannot be distinguished when one is restricted to decohered input and output states. The studied problems arise naturally in the presence of a superselection rule, allow one to quantify the amount of information that can be encoded in phase degrees of freedom (coherences), and are related to time-energy uncertainty relation. We present a collection of results on both necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of \(M\) perfectly distinguishable states (channels) that are classically indistinguishable.

                                <p><i>Abstract: </i>Is it always possible to explain random stochastic transitions between states of a finite-dimensional system as arising from the deterministic quantum evolution of the system? If not, then what is the minimal amount of randomness required by quantum theory to explain a given stochastic process? Here, we address this problem by studying possible coherifications of a quantum channel \(\Phi\), i.e., we look for channels \(\Phi^{\mathcal{C}}\) that induce the same classical transitions \(T\), but are "more coherent". To quantify the coherence of a channel \(\Phi\) we measure the coherence of the corresponding Jamiołkowski state \(J_{\Phi}\). We show that the classical transition matrix \(T\) can be coherified to reversible unitary dynamics if and only if \(T\) is unistochastic. Otherwise the Jamiołkowski state \(J_\Phi^{\mathcal{C}}\) of the optimally coherified channel is mixed, and the dynamics must necessarily be irreversible. To asses the extent to which an optimal process \(\Phi^{\mathcal{C}}\) is indeterministic we find explicit bounds on the entropy and purity of \(J_\Phi^{\mathcal{C}}\), and relate the latter to the unitarity of \(\Phi^{\mathcal{C}}\). We also find optimal coherifications for several classes of channels, including all one-qubit channels. Finally, we provide a non-optimal coherification procedure that works for an arbitrary channel \(\Phi\) and reduces its rank (the minimal number of required Kraus operators) from \(d^2\) to \(d\).

                                <p><i>Abstract: </i>Both conservation laws and practical restrictions impose symmetry constraints on the dynamics of open quantum systems. In the case of time-translation symmetry, which arises naturally in many physically relevant scenarios, the quantum coherence between energy eigenstates becomes a valuable resource for quantum information processing. In this work we identify the minimum amount of decoherence compatible with this symmetry for a given population dynamics. This yields a generalisation to higher-dimensional systems of the relation \(T_2\leq 2T_1\) for qubit decoherence and relaxation times. It also enables us to witness and assess the role of non-Markovianity as a resource for coherence preservation and transfer. Moreover, we discuss the relationship between ergodicity and the ability of Markovian dynamics to indefinitely sustain a superposition of different energy states. Finally, we establish a formal connection between the resource-theoretic and the master equation approaches to thermodynamics, with the former being a non-Markovian generalisation of the latter. Our work thus brings the abstract study of quantum coherence as a resource towards the realm of actual physical applications.

                                <p><i>Popular summary:</i> Quantum bits differ substantially from classical ones since, like Schrödinger’s cat, they can exist in a superposition of two different states. This wave-like nature is a key ingredient of quantum computing, but it is very fragile and can easily be destroyed. Whereas one could keep track of the intermediate steps of computation performed on a classical computer without interfering with the calculation itself, in a quantum computer superpositions must be hidden until the final result is obtained. A major goal is then to prevent the leakage of quantum information from the computer, a process known as "decoherence". Here we provide a general framework to quantify the minimal decoherence experienced by a quantum mechanical system. Our main result is a minimal decoherence theorem that gives a fundamental upper bound on the amount of superposition that can be preserved when energy leaks from a system into the surrounding environment. The theorem has a range of consequences, since it generalises the notion of relaxation and decoherence times used in NMR spectroscopy, allows us to understand the role of memory effects in decoherence processes, and identifies what kind of energy flows are compatible with the preservation of superpositions. In this work we show how novel quantum information tools characterising superposition as a resource can be employed to study decoherence processes, thus bridging the gap between abstract theory and the realm of physical applications.</p>

				<p>Until the early 1900s uncertainty was not considered to be a fundamental concept – rather it was a statement about the imperfection of our tools and observation methods. The advent of quantum mechanics, however, changed this perspective completely. We now know that while classical uncertainty arises from ignorance, quantum phenomena are irreducibly unpredictable: even for a single fixed measurement and a pure quantum state of maximal knowledge, we can typically only make probabilistic predictions. The situation worsens when we consider measurements of observables that do not commute – there exist fundamental constraints on our ability to make predictions about either possible set of outcomes. The most celebrated such constraint is the Heisenberg-Robertson uncertainty relation; however, over time, the study of uncertainty relations has itself become a major topic and has played an important role in uncovering the mysteries of the quantum realm. In particular, a variety of quantum information problems can be phrased in the language of uncertainty relations, including quantum cryptographic security proofs, quantitative wave-particle duality relations and witnessing entanglement.</p>
                <p>
                In my research I focus on the interplay between quantum and classical uncertainty. The motivation comes from the fact the original uncertainty relations, developed when physicists were mostly interested in extreme scenarios and ultimate bounds, were restricted to quantum systems prepared in pure states of maximal knowledge. However, as soon as uncertainty relations are used to study quantum information problems, the investigated systems are not necessarily prepared in pure states. In fact, most quantum states arising in theoretical considerations (e.g., in entanglement theory) and the ones used to describe quantum systems prepared in laboratories are mixed. Therefore, a proper understanding of the interplay between classical lack of knowledge and purely quantum uncertainty coming from coherence is crucial for quantum information based technologies.</p>

                                <p><i>Abstract: </i>Which quantum states minimise the unavoidable uncertainty arising from the non-commutativity of two observables? The immediate answer to such a question is: it depends. Due to the plethora of uncertainty measures there are many answers. Here, instead of restricting our study to a particular measure, we present plausible axioms for the set \(\mathcal{F}\) of bona-fide information-theoretic uncertainty functions. Then, we discuss the existence of states minimising uncertainty with respect to all members of \(\mathcal{F}\), i.e., universal minimum uncertainty states (MUS). We prove that such states do not exist within the full state space and study the effect of classical noise on the structure of minimum uncertainty states. We present an explicit example of a qubit universal MUS that arises when purity is constrained by introducing a threshold amount of noise. For higher dimensional systems we derive several no-go results limiting the existence of noisy universal MUS. However, we conjecture that universality may emerge in an approximate sense. We conclude by discussing connections with thermodynamics, and highlight the privileged role that non-equilibrium free energy \(F_2\) plays close to equilibrium.

                                <p><i>Abstract: </i>How much of the uncertainty in predicting measurement outcomes for non-commuting quantum observables is genuinely quantum mechanical? We provide a natural decomposition of the total entropic uncertainty of two non-commuting observables into a classical component, and an intrinsically quantum mechanical component. We show that the total quantum component in a state is never lower or upper bounded by any state-independent quantities, but instead admits "purity-based" lower bounds that generalize entropic formulations such as the Maassen-Uffink relation. These relations reveal a non-trivial interplay between quantum and classical randomness in any finite-dimensional state.

                                <p><i>Abstract: </i>We argue for an operational requirement that all state-dependent measures of disturbance should satisfy. Motivated by this natural criterion, we prove that in any \(d\)-dimensional Hilbert space and for any pair of non-commuting operators, \(A\) and \(B\), there exists a set of at least \(2^{d−1}\) zero-noise, zero-disturbance (ZNZD) states, for which the first observable can be measured without noise and the second will not be disturbed. Moreover, we show that it is possible to construct such ZNZD states for which the expectation value of the commutator \([A,B]\) does not vanish. Therefore any state-dependent error-disturbance relation, based on the expectation value of the commutator as a lower bound, must violate the operational requirement. We also discuss Ozawa's state-dependent error-disturbance relation in light of our results and show that the disturbance measure used in this relation exhibits unphysical properties. We conclude that the trade-off is inevitable only between state-independent measures of error and disturbance.

                                <p><i>Popular summary:</i> The uncertainty principle lies at the very heart of quantum physics. Its best known formulation, the Heisenberg-Robertson inequality, states that two physical properties of any quantum system that are represented by non-commuting observables, cannot simultaneously have well defined values. It has been speculated for a number of years that the so-called error-disturbance relation is a direct consequence of this well-established inequality. In its state-dependent form it states that given a physical system in a known quantum state, one cannot sequentially perform measurements of two non-commuting observables perfectly. In other words: either the first measurement has to be imperfect (noisy) or the second one has to be disturbed. In this paper, assuming only that a noisy or disturbed measurement should be experimentally distinguishable from a perfect one, we prove that this is actually not the case. We show that for every quantum system there exist quantum states for which it is possible to perform perfect, i.e., noiseless and undisturbed, measurements of two non-commuting observables. This demonstrates that it is not only the measurement process that is responsible for the disturbance to subsequent measurements, but also the lack of knowledge about the initial quantum state. We conclude that in order to properly understand error-disturbance relation, one should seek for a state-independent formulation that takes into account this lack of knowledge.</p>

                                <p><i>Abstract: </i> We present two classical algorithms for the simulation of universal quantum circuits on \(n\) qubits constructed from \(c\) instances of Clifford gates and \(t\) arbitrary-angle \(Z\)-rotation gates such as \(T\) gates. Our algorithms complement each other by performing best in different parameter regimes. The \(\tt{Estimate}\) algorithm produces an additive precision estimate of the Born rule probability of a chosen measurement outcome with the only source of run-time inefficiency being a linear dependence on the stabilizer extent (which scales like \(\approx 1.17t\) for \(T\) gates). Our algorithm is state-of-the-art for this task: as an example, in approximately 25 hours (on a standard desktop computer), we estimated the Born rule probability to within an additive error of 0.03, for a 50 qubit, 60 non-Clifford gate quantum circuit with more than 2000 Clifford gates. The \(\tt{Compute}\) algorithm calculates the probability of a chosen measurement outcome to machine precision with run-time \(O(2t−r(t−r)t)\) where \(r\) is an efficiently computable, circuit-specific quantity. With high probability, \(r\) is very close to \(\min\{t,n−w\}\) for random circuits with many Clifford gates, where \(w\) is the number of measured qubits. \(\tt{Compute}\) can be effective in surprisingly challenging parameter regimes, e.g., we can randomly sample Clifford+\(T\) circuits with \(n=55\), \(w=5\), \(c=105\) and \(t=80\) \(T\) gates, and then compute the Born rule probability with a run-time consistently less than 104 seconds using a single core of a standard desktop computer. We provide a C+Python implementation of our algorithms.

Its subset \(\mathcal{U}_d\) of unistochastic matrices, determined by squared moduli of unitary matrices, is of a particular importance for quantum theory as classical dynamical systems described by unistochastic transition matrices can be quantised. In order to investigate the problem of unistochasticity we introduce the set \(\mathcal{L}_d\) of bracelet matrices that forms a subset of \(\mathcal{B}_d\), but a superset of \(\mathcal{U}_d\). We prove that for every dimension \(d\) this set contains the set of factorisable bistochastic matrices \(\mathcal{F}_d\) and is closed under matrix multiplication by elements of \(\mathcal{F}_d\). Moreover, we prove that both \(\mathcal{L}_d\) and \(\mathcal{F}_d\) are star-shaped with respect to the flat matrix. We also analyse the set of \(d\times d\) unistochastic matrices arising from circulant unitary matrices, and show that their spectra lie inside \(d\)-hypocycloids on the complex plane. Finally, applying our results to small dimensions, we fully characterise the set of circulant unistochastic matrices of order \(d\leq 4\), and prove that such matrices form a monoid for \(d=3\).

                                <p><i>Abstract: </i>To what extent does Noether's principle apply to quantum channels? Here, we quantify the degree to which imposing a symmetry constraint on quantum channels implies a conservation law, and show that this relates to physically impossible transformations in quantum theory, such as time-reversal and spin-inversion. In this analysis, the convex structure and extremal points of the set of quantum channels symmetric under the action of a Lie group \(G\) becomes essential. It allows us to derive bounds on the deviation from conservation laws under any symmetric quantum channel in terms of the deviation from closed dynamics as measured by the unitarity of the channel. In particular, we investigate in detail the U(1) and SU(2) symmetries related to energy and angular momentum conservation laws. In the latter case, we provide fundamental limits on how much a spin-\(j_A\) system can be used to polarise a larger spin-\(j_B\) system, and on how much one can invert spin polarisation using a rotationally-symmetric operation. Finally, we also establish novel links between unitarity, complementary channels and purity that are of independent interest.

                                <p><i>Popular summary:</i> Noether’s theorem is a celebrated result showing that continuous symmetries are intimately related to conservation laws. For example, the fact that no point in time is special leads to energy conservation, while rotational symmetry results in conservation of angular momentum. These important relations placed symmetries at the forefront of modern physics. However, their applicability is mostly constrained to classical and quantum systems that are isolated. In this work we address the fundamental question: to what degree does Noether’s principle hold for open (non-isolated) quantum systems that possess a continuous symmetry? Consequently, we quantify the admissible disconnects that occur in quantum theory between conservation laws and symmetries of open systems, and uncover their highly nontrivial structure that is related to physically impossible quantum processes, such as spin-inversion and time-reversal. Our analysis strongly relates to core results from entanglement theory and recent theories of coherent resources, and uses techniques from quantum information theory that have been remarkably successful in quantifying general limitations on quantum processing tasks. We obtain novel structural results that describe the set of all quantum operations respecting a symmetry principle. Employing these, we derive general trade-off relations between deviations from conservation laws and openness of quantum dynamics that obeys a given symmetry. Besides providing fundamental insights into the structure of quantum theory, our results are of relevance for a range of research areas, such as open system dynamics, quantum information science and the development of quantum technologies. Moreover, our technical results on reversibility of quantum dynamics can find applications in randomized benchmarking of quantum information processing devices and decoherence theory.</p>

                                <p><i>Abstract: </i>We propose a quantum-state transfer protocol in a spin chain that requires only the control of the spins at the ends of the quantum wire. The protocol is to a large extent insensitive to inhomogeneity caused by local magnetic fields and perturbation of exchange couplings. Moreover, apart from the free evolution regime, it allows one to induce an adiabatic spin transfer, which provides the possibility of performing the transfer on demand. We also show that the amount of information leaking into the central part of the chain is small throughout the whole transfer process (which protects the information sent from being eavesdropped) and can be controlled by the magnitude of the external magnetic field.

                                <p><i>Abstract: </i>Understanding and controlling the spin dynamics in semiconductor heterostructures is a key requirement for the design of future spintronics devices. In GaAs-based heterostructures, electrons and holes have very different spin dynamics. Some control over the spin-orbit fields, which drive the electron spin dynamics, is possible by choosing the crystallographic growth axis. Here, (110)-grown structures are interesting, as the Dresselhaus spinorbit fields are oriented along the growth axis and therefore, the typically dominant Dyakonov-Perel mechanism is suppressed for spins oriented along this axis, leading to long spin depasing times. By contrast, hole spin dephasing is typically very rapid due to the strong spin-orbit interaction of the p-like valence band states. For localized holes, however, most spin dephasing mechanisms are suppressed, and long spin dephasing times may be observed. Here, we present a study of electron and hole spin dynamics in GaAs-AlGaAs-based quantum wells. We apply the resonant spin amplification (RSA) technique, which allows us to extract all relevant spin dynamics parameters, such as \(g\) factors and dephasing times with high accuracy. A comparison of the measured RSA traces with the developed theory reveals the anisotropy of the spin dephasing in the (110)-grown two-dimensional electron systems, as well as the complex interplay between electron and hole spin and carrier dynamics in the two-dimensional hole systems.

We observe that nonresonant or high-power optical pumping leads to a resident hole spin polarization with opposite sign with respect to the optically oriented carriers, while low-power resonant optical pumping only leads to a resident hole spin polarization if a sufficient in-plane magnetic field is applied. The competition between two different processes of spin orientation strongly modifies the shape of resonant spin amplification traces. Calculations of the spin dynamics in the electron-hole system are in good agreement with the experimental Kerr rotation and resonant spin amplification traces and allow us to determine the hole spin polarization within the sample after optical orientation, as well as to extract quantitative information about spin dephasing processes at various stages of the evolution.
